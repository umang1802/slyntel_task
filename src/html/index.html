                            If you asked someone what “sales intelligence” was a decade ago, they’d have mostly likely drawn a blank to your question. Sales intelligence as we know it today simply did not exist back then. While it was a requirement that sales teams of the past were yearning to find a solution for (as they do today), the technology to support the requirement was not easy to build. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content-text">
                            Today, thanks to the thriving universe of SaaS products and the technological leaps that we’ve made, sales intelligence is powerful and accessible—enabling sales teams to sell better, faster, and with more insight than ever before. But what is sales intelligence, really? What are the building blocks that it is made up of, how can it impact your company, and how will it evolve in the future? That’s exactly what we’ll be exploring today. Let’s dive right into it.

                            Sales intelligence, in a nutshell, refers to the information and insights that companies can have about their prospective buyers. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content-text">
                            As a sales representative, manager, or VP, you’d want to have the most up-to-date, relevant, and personalized information about your target account’s users, buyers, and decision-makers. The more information you have about your prospects, the more are your chances of closing the sale, just because of that fact that you were able to accurately determine when they want your product/service and why they should want it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content-text">
                            Sales intelligence helps you find the right kind of prospects for your company, enables you to reach them on the right platform, build a pitch that address their exact pain points, and shorten the time that it takes to close the deal. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content-text">
                            While that should give you a well-rounded idea of what sales intelligence is, we often find that several other things are often misconstrued as sales intelligence while they really aren’t. Let’s take a closer look at what those are.

                            Several companies out there provide leads or contact information to sales teams and call themselves sales intelligence firms. There are also plenty of tools out there that allow companies to track basic (or perhaps slightly more advanced) sales metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), average deal size, etc. on “sales intelligence dashboards”. 
                        </p>

                            While these are important facts and metrics that sales teams in any organization can benefit from, they aren’t really sales intelligence. Let’s take a look at the elements that make up sales intelligence, and the benefits of using it.

                                    Organizational charts, often alternatively referred to as organigrams or organograms, are a visual representation of a company’s structure. This chart enlists the employees of an organization and maps each of them out with respect to other employees within the organization—may it be peers, subordinates, or reporting managers.

                                    Organograms can help you gain a fair understanding of how the reporting structure in an organization works.

They also allow you to understand who your product/service’s users are going to be in that organization, and if you have a product that can help multiple teams or divisions of a company, it paves the path for you to cross-sell and upsell your product across different functions of the company.

                                Firmographics allow you to segment your target accounts and prospects based on several criteria, and provide you with a much deeper understanding of your target markets. They also aid in gathering industry trends and build vertical-specific messaging and pitches to improve conversions.

                            As we saw earlier, sales intelligence is all about improving the efficiency with which your sales force operates—in other words, increasing conversion rates while reducing the time it takes to garner more prospects and close deals. Having raw, unprocessed data can be of no aid to your business if these are the goals that your team sets out to achieve. Sales intelligence, however, isn’t unprocessed data; it’s a collection of data-driven information and contextual insights that are built with the sole intention of helping your organization’s sales force. Let’s take a deeper look at some examples of actionable sales intelligence, how it is calculated, and how it can help your team sell better.

Lead scoring is typically calculated by tracking the number of times a customer has interacted or engaged with your company’s website, content, emails, or employees, but can also be formulated using everything that we’ve discussed in this post thus far.

                            Like it is the case with any other data-powered business solution, the impact and usefulness of sales intelligence is directly reliant on the accuracy, depth, and up-to-dateness of the information presented to your brand. “Bad data” that is out-of-date, incorrect, or wrongly attributed can affect the decisions that your sales force makes, and can negatively impact your sales as well. However, this can be easily tackled by:

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Always having a timestamp that represents when the information was updated last
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Manually verifying samples of data to see whether they meet quality standards

                            Good sales intelligence software has all these in place, so this shouldn’t really be a can of worms as long as you buy your information from a reputable sales intel company.

                            Sales intelligence is, by all means, valuable information for any company or team, and it isn’t inexpensive by any standards. But that doesn’t mean that it isn’t useful for your company. Sales intelligence can help you gain insights that will save you thousands of man-hours and help million dollar sales that might not have been possible without it—but keep in mind that it works best for companies that have large average deal values.
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content-text">
                            If you’re a smaller brand that’s just setting out selling software, invest your sales funds wisely. An early-stage startup with less than $20k in ARR might not be able to file ROIs that justify the cost. However, if you’re a larger organization, sales intel could help you go from being neck-to-neck with your biggest competitor to being the industry leader (assuming your competition isn’t using sales intelligence as well 😉)

                            Sales intelligence, however, isn’t unprocessed data; it’s a collection of data-driven information and contextual insights that are built with the sole intention of helping your organization’s sales force. Let’s take a deeper look at some examples of actionable sales intelligence, how it is calculated, and how it can help your team sell better.

                            We’ve spent a lot of time talking about what Sales Intelligence is all about and how far it’s come, but where do we see it going from here? These are our predictions for the future of sales intelligence.

                            The sales intelligence marketing is rapidly expanding, and users are always on the lookout for more reliable and comprehensive information about their target accounts. Over the next 3 to 5 years, sales intelligence products will focus on improving the quality of the information they provide, and greatly focus on capturing and distributing more data points to clients. After that, though, the industry is wide open and the possibilities are endless.

                            In a world where AI and predictive analytics are two of the top technologies that companies are invested in, sales intelligence will likely soon include a great deal of AI-assisted personalization that will help sales folks tell their customers exactly what they want to hear to close down sales faster. Bots could also help sales people approach prospects at the most probabilistically opportune moments to improve deal conversion rates.

                            Data protection is also a hot topic right now, and companies, especially large firms like FAMGA, are taking privacy seriously. This might, in fact, spawn a new industry that’s focused on guarding sales people’s access to all the data we discussed in this post, and gaining these insights and information might by itself be a new challenge for this industry.
